# the values to match your export. Analytics vendors ship 50+ column exports
# and only the identity fields are worth carrying over.
#
# Contact and email columns are deliberately NOT mapped. Exports like these
# list every staff account on the shop, in no useful order: agencies,
# freelancers, and the app's own team. Contact 1 is not the merchant, no other
# index is either, and a dashboard column headed "who to write to" that names
# somebody else's agency is worse than a blank. See migration 008.
