"""One definition per number, written once.

Every figure on a dashboard is somebody's decision about what to count, and a
reader who cannot see that decision has to either trust it blind or go and read
the SQL. Mixpanel solves this with Lexicon: descriptions live on the event, not
in a wiki, and surface inside the report itself. This is the same idea at the
size this app actually is -- a dict, not a governance product.

The registry is the single source. The tiles read it for the hover panel and
`docs/architecture.md` points at this file rather than restating anything. A
definition can therefore be wrong, but it
cannot be *inconsistent*, which is the failure that actually happens: the page
says one thing, the doc says another, and nobody knows which shipped first.

`rule` is deliberately close to the SQL rather than a paraphrase of it. A
paraphrase is what drifts.
