    Behind a TLS-terminating proxy, request.client.host is the proxy on every
    request, which would collapse every caller into one bucket: a limiter that
    limits nothing. TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP_HEADER names the header to read instead.

    **The rightmost entry, not the leftmost.** Proxies APPEND to
    X-Forwarded-For, so the leftmost entry is whatever the client sent and the
    rightmost is what your own proxy actually observed. Reading the leftmost
    lets a caller pick a fresh bucket per request by rotating a header value,
    which defeats the brute-force guard entirely. Single-value headers
    (Fly-Client-IP, CF-Connecting-IP, X-Real-IP) carry one entry and are
    unaffected either way; prefer one of those.

    With more than one proxy in front, the rightmost entry is the nearest proxy
    rather than the client, so everyone behind it shares a bucket. That is a
    weaker limiter, not a bypass, which is the right way round.

    The value must parse as an IP address. Without that check the bucket key is
    an arbitrary caller-supplied string, so the keyspace is unbounded and an
    8KB header becomes an 8KB dict key. Anything unparseable falls back to the
    socket peer, as does an absent header, which is correct with no proxy in
    front and in tests.
