"""The numbers-don't-match questions, answered once.

Modelled on Mixpanel's per-report FAQ pages, which exist for one reason: almost
every support question an analytics product gets is "why don't these two numbers
agree", and almost every answer is "they measure different things and both are
right". Writing that down once is cheaper than explaining it each time, and it
is the difference between a reader distrusting the dashboard and a reader
understanding it.

Plain prose, no markup. The same list renders as HTML at /faq and as markdown at
/faq.md, so anything that needed escaping in one and not the other would be a
bug waiting to happen. Questions are ordered by how often they actually come up.

            "They are not the same measurement and they never will be. MRR is a "
            "projection of a state: what the subscriptions that exist right now "
            "are worth per month. Collected revenue is a record of what moved: "
            "what Shopify actually billed and what actually reached the payout.",

            "MRR and still in every month of collected revenue they ever paid "

            "Both are on Overview on purpose. If you want to know what the "

        [
            "Because MRR is monthly by definition, so an annual plan counts as "
            "one twelfth of its price. A $120/year plan is $10 of monthly "
            "recurring revenue. Counting it at $120 would make one annual "
            "subscriber look like a dozen monthly ones and make MRR jump and "

            "are recognised per app by price via `annual_plan_amounts` in "

            "and payments across the catalog. The same Shopify shop installed "
            "in two apps counts twice because those are two product relationships, "
            "with separate revenue and churn.",

        [
            "Shopify's exit survey is multi-select. One merchant can tick "
            "\"too expensive\" and \"missing features\" and the bars count both, "

            "far fewer merchants answered while it was optional. Pooling the "
            "two eras would bury a near-census under a mostly empty "
            "denominator, so the bars count the mandatory era only and the "
            "Churn page states both halves next to them. The boundary date is "
            "REASON_MANDATORY_FROM, which is configured rather than reported by "

            "event, and a merchant who left in March and reinstalled in June has "
            "a March row and a current state of installed.",

            "That is also why the days column on a churn row measures the stay "

            "feed calls both of them the same thing.",

            "Anything on this dashboard about why merchants leave counts only the "
            "first kind, because a store Shopify closed never chose to go and was "
            "never shown the exit survey. The second kind is counted separately "
