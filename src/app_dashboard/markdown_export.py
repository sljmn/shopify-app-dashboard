"""Every page, as a markdown document an agent can read.

Same shape Shopify uses on shopify.dev: YAML frontmatter naming the page and
where it came from, then prose, then the data itself as JSON. The prose exists
so a model reading this cold does not have to guess what a number means; the
JSON exists so it does not have to parse a table.

Two rules hold everywhere in here:

- **No merchant contact details.** Shop names and domains identify a business
  and stay; owner names and email addresses are dropped. A copied document is
  one paste away from a third-party model, and that is not a decision to make on
  a merchant's behalf. The stripping here is belt-and-braces: migration 008
  emptied both columns outright, so there is currently nothing to strip.
- **Every caveat that lives in a footnote on the page lives in the prose here.**
  A model that does not know deactivations are folded into uninstalls will
  confidently report the wrong churn number.

READING_NOTES = """## How to read this

- Every number on this dashboard carries its own definition, and they are all at
  `/faq.md` along with the reasons two figures that look like they should agree do not.
- Money is monthly. An annual plan counts as one twelfth of its price, so it
  never inflates MRR against a monthly subscriber.
- "Uninstalled" in the raw event feed covers two different things: a merchant who
  chose to leave, and a store Shopify closed or froze. Anything about why merchants
  leave counts only the first kind. The Churn page reports the second kind separately.
- Uninstall reasons are multi-select and Shopify serves the question in the merchant's
  own admin language. Reasons are grouped into canonical buckets here, and the bucket
  counts sum to more than the number of merchants. Shopify made answering mandatory
  partway through 2026, so reason data splits into a sparse era and a near-complete
  one; the `era` block on the Churn page carries both and the buckets count the
  mandatory era only.
- Merchant contact details (owner names, email addresses) are deliberately omitted
  from this document. Shop names and domains are not.
