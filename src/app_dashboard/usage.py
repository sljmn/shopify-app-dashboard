"""Product-usage events pushed by the app itself, and the activation reports
built on them.

Everything the Partner API knows is lifecycle: installed, paid, left. It has no
idea whether a merchant ever configured anything, so "installed but never
activated" is invisible from that side. This module is the receiving half of the fix; the
app-side contract is `docs/usage-events-integration.md`.

The endpoint is fed by an external caller holding a shared secret, so validation
here is deliberately strict and total: unknown event types are rejected rather
than stored, every string is length-capped, and `properties` is capped and must
be a flat JSON object. A caller that is buggy or compromised should be able to
lose its own data, not fill the disk or poison a report.
