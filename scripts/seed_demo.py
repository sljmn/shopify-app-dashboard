"""Fill a database with a synthetic app's history, so the dashboard can be run
without Partner API tokens. It creates two apps with overlapping shop GIDs so
the combined dashboard and app selector both have meaningful data.

Every merchant here is invented. Domains are prefixed `demo-` so a screenshot or
a shared screen can never be mistaken for somebody's real install base, and the
uninstall reasons are Shopify's own pick-list strings (including the localised
ones) so the normaliser has something real to normalise.

It writes through the same functions the live pipeline uses -- upsert_raw_events,
upsert_charges, upsert_transactions, then derive_installation -- rather than
inserting derived rows directly. A seeder that wrote `subscriptions` itself could
produce a dashboard the real code path cannot, which would make it a liar.
