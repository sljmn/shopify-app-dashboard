"""Things that must be true of any consistent dataset, not golden numbers.

Every figure on this dashboard is computed by more than one code path -- the
Active MRR tile, the MRR chart and the plan-mix table each write their own SQL
over the same rows. When those paths disagree, a human notices two tiles
contradicting each other on the same screen, which is how the scalar-MRR bug was
found. These assertions are that comparison, run on every `pytest` instead of by
eye.

They are deliberately written against a seeded *world* rather than fixed
expected values, so they keep holding as the pipeline changes. `scripts/
check_invariants.py` runs the same checks against production.
